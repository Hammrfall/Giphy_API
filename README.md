# Giphy_API

This page uses the giphy API to collect 10 gifs at a time when a button is clicked.  If the user clicks the same button again, 10 new gifs are added to the existing ones, appearing at the top of the display area. 

The gifs toggle between static and animated when the user clicks on them.

The user can also create their own search buttons.  The system prevents entering an empty button, or one that already exists.

The page is also media responsive, so it works on mobile devices as well.
