# Giphy_API

This page uses the giphy API to collect 10 gifs at a time when a button is clicked.  If the user clicks the same button again, 10 new gifs are added to the existing ones, and sent to the top of the display area. 

The gifs toggle between static and animated when the user clicks on them.

The user can also create their own buttons.  The system prevents entering an empty button, or one that already exists.
